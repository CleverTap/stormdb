**Current Status:** Used in production by CleverTap.

## Goals
- High speed sequential read
- High speed random writes
- Affinity to cluster recently updated keys for higher random IO on such keys
- Ability to recover from file corruption

## Benchmarks
We ran a small benchmark for 100 million 4 byte keys with 28 byte values, and the results are shown below:

### Iteration
<img src="./static/iteration_28_bytes_100m.svg"/>

### Random
<img src="./static/random_28_bytes_100m.svg"/>

**Note:** We've only compared this with RocksDB since in all our previous benchmarks, 
we've observed that RocksDB was the fastest.

More details about this benchmark may be found [here](https://github.com/CleverTap/stormdb/wiki/Benchmarks).

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind StormDB was to achieve fast sequential scans across all keys
in the database. When we benchmarked sequential reads of popular key value stores, we realised:
1. None of them are as fast as simply reading the file from an SSD
    - We used `time cat 4GB_file >> /dev/null` to understand the raw throughput possible
    - None of the key value stores out there delivered anything close to this
1. Most are based on LSM, which requires all data to be sorted
    - This inherently doesn't provide an optimised technique to cluster recently
      updated keys together
1. Although a few keys are frequently updated and queried, LSM based stores would require
   all their data to be cached by the operating system file cache
    - On the contrary, StormDB clusters recently updated keys at the head of its data file
    - Therefore, the operating system can cache just the head of the data file,
      and provide high throughput random reads without caching the entire data file

## Getting Started
1. Add the Maven dependency
```xml
<!-- Heads up! Use the latest version from https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.clevertap/stormdb -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.clevertap</groupId>
    <artifactId>stormdb</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```
2. Create and use a StormDB instance
```java
// Create.
final StormDB db = new StormDBBuilder()
        .withDbDir("path/to/db")
        .withValueSize(28)
        .build();

// Put.
db.put(1, new byte[28]);

// Get.
final byte[] value = db.randomGet(1);

// Iterate over all keys.
db.iterate((key, data, dataOffset) -> {
    // Read 28 bytes starting at dataOffset in data[]. 
});

// Close.
db.close();
```

## Limitations
- Key sizes are restricted to 4 bytes (they're stored as integers internally)
- A database must be opened indicating the value size
    - As a result, once created, all values are always of the specified size
    - This is fixed, as StormDB is an offset based database

## FAQs    
### When should I consider using StormDB?
- Your keys are limited to 4 bytes (a maximum of ~4.2 billion keys per database)
- The size of your values are fixed
- You need to iterate over all keys very quickly (and not sorted in any order, other than recently updated keys)

If the answers to all the points above are a hard "yes", then you'd benefit from StormDB.
