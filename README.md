# StormDB
An embeddable, persistent key-value store optimised for sequential reads.

**Important Notice:** This database is under heavy development,
and is not yet ready for production usage.

## Goals
- High speed sequential read
- High speed random writes
- Affinity to cluster recently updated keys for higher random IO on such keys
- Ability to recover from file corruption

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind StormDB was to achieve fast sequential scans across all keys
in the database. When we benchmarked sequential reads of popular key value stores, we realised:
1. None of them are as fast as simply reading the file from an SSD
    - We used `time cat 4GB_file >> /dev/null` to understand the raw throughput possible
    - None of the key value stores out there delivered anything close to this
1. Most are based on LSM, which requires all data to be sorted
    - This inherently doesn't provide an optimised technique to cluster recently
      updated keys together
1. Although a few keys are frequently updated and queried, LSM based stores would require
   all their data to be cached by the operating system file cache
    - On the contrary, StormDB clusters recently updated keys at the head of its data file
    - Therefore, the operating system can cache just the head of the data file,
      and provide high throughput random reads without caching the entire data file

## Limitations
- Key sizes are restricted to 4 bytes (they're stored as integers internally)
- A database must be opened indicating the value size
    - As a result, once created, all values are always of the specified size
    - This is fixed, as StormDB is an offset based database

## FAQs    
### When should I consider using StormDB?
- Your keys are limited to 4 bytes (a maximum of ~4.2 billion keys per database)
- The size of your values are fixed
- You need to iterate over all keys very quickly (and not sorted in any order, other than recently updated keys)

If the answers to all the points above are a hard "yes", then you'd benefit from StormDB.
